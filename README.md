# Overview

  Bottom Line is a real estate analysis app to determine potential cash flow of prospective properties. This app solves the problem of figuring out if a rental property will have positive or negative cashflow, based on how the property would potentially be purchased (purchase price, financing, etc.) A user is able to type the address that they want to analyze into the search bar on the main page, they'll then be taken to the analysis page where they can type in potential purchase paramaters to determine what their monthly chas flow will be. Average rent is automatically determined.
